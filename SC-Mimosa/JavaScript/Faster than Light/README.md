# Faster than Light

## Description

In the "Faster than Light" challenge, participants are tasked with discovering a hidden password within the webpage source code. This challenge emphasizes the importance of developers not leaving sensitive information, such as passwords or development comments, within the code of their webpages. During this challenge, a "clean-up" script is employed to remove developer comments, but the password can still be located.

Participants are required to inspect the source code of the webpage, named `faster-than-light`, to find the hidden password. The challenge serves as a real-world example of how overlooked details in web development can lead to security vulnerabilities.

## Objective

Your task is to find the hidden password in the source code of the `faster-than-light` file. This will demonstrate an understanding of how to view webpage source code and the importance of proper information handling in web development.

## Solution

1. Open the `faster-than-light` file in a web browser.
2. Access the source code of the webpage. This can typically be done by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting "View Page Source" or similar option, depending on the browser.
3. Search through the source code for any comments or strings that might contain the password. Developer comments are often found in `<!-- -->` tags in HTML.
4. Locate the password. In this challenge, you will find the comment: `<!-- Hello! My password is... "i_weave_light". -->`
5. Use this password (`i_weave_light`) as the key to complete the challenge.
