# SP Assignments
This repository contains assignments submitted to the Diploma in Information Security (rebranded to Diploma in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics) course at Singapore Polytechnic.

Should Singapore Polytechnic reuse the same assignment, the code provided in this repository should not be used as it is. Instead, it should be used as a reference to understand the concepts and the implementation of the assignment.

I will not be held responsible for any misuse of the code provided in this repository, or any academic dishonesty that may arise from the reuse of the code. Plagiarism is a serious offence and copy-pasting code from this repository will 100% result in a detection for plagiarism.

## Modules
- [Applied Cryptography CA1](./ACG-CA1/)
    * A research project on cryptography and the use of encryption algorithms for confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data.
    * Grade: A
- [Applied Crypto CA2](./ACG-CA2/)
    * A client-server application that uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption to secure the communication between the client and the server.
    * Grade: A
- [Backend Web Development CA1](./BED-CA1/)
    * A (mostly backend) web application written in Node.js that uses Express.js and MySQL to create a simple game searching website, contains 4 additional features related to image addition using Multer, asynchronous database queries using Promises, and user authentication & password storage using bcrypt.
    * Grade: DIST
- [Backend Web Development CA2](./BED-CA2/)
    > continuation of BED-CA1
    * A full-stack web application written in Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL that uses a combination of server-side and client-side rendering to create a simple game searching website, user authentication and ACL via JWT, and a RESTful API for CRUD operations.
    * Grade: DIST
- [Fundamentals of Programming](./FOP-CA2/)
    * A simple CLI application written in Node.js that has 2 portions, a member client and an admin client. I genuinely don't remember what this assignment was about, but I implemented gambling in the member client /shrug
    * Grade: DIST
- [Python for Security CA1](./PSEC-CA1/)
    * A... hangman.... game... written in Python, don't ask why it's in a security module, I don't know either.
    * Grade: A
- [Python for Security CA2](./PSEC-CA2/)
    * A Python application that uses the `nmap` package to perform pseudo-automatic scanning of targets, simulated FTP connections in memory, and a custom packet manipulation tool with `scapy` to perform IP spoofing.
    * Grade: A
- [Secure Coding - Mimosa](./SC-Mimosa/)
    * https://github.com/OWASP/mimosa
    * Grade: TBD
